  WUVARS is a set of software tools developed to access,
  process, analyze, and visualize time-series photometry
  from UKIRT's WFCAM instrument, after being processed 
  through the WFCAM Science Archive.

  The primary software modules are located in the tr/ 
  subdirectory.

  WUVARS is written in Python, heavily using the NumPy, 
  Matplotlib, and ATpy packages.
