  WUVARS is a set of software tools developed to access,
  process, analyze, and visualize time-series photometry
  from UKIRT's WFCAM instrument, after being processed 
  through the WFCAM Science Archive.

  The primary software modules are located in the tr/ 
  subdirectory.

  A description of the main modules:
    tr/plot2.py - used to visualize lightcurves
    tr/scargle.py - performs Lomb-Scargle Periodogram analysis
    tr/chi2.py - interfaces with Palmer's Fast Chi-Squared 
                 frequency analysis
    tr/spreadsheet.py - calculates statistics of photometry &
    		      	variability for lists of stars
    tr/stetson.py - calculates the Stetson variability index
    tr/robust.py - calculates Robust statistics
    tr/timing.py - implements a filter for periodogram frequencies
    tr/tr_helpers.py - contains a number of helper functions 
    		       used in the above packages

  WUVARS is written in Python, heavily using the NumPy, 
  Matplotlib, and ATpy packages.
